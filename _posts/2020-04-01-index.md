# Intro

By [@jmcrookston](https://twitter.com/jmcrookston) and [@niemkiewiczIP](https://twitter.com/niemkiewiczIP)  

We are two Toronto intellectual property lawyers with science backgrounds and experience in pharmaceutical/health issues. This site provides general information about COVID-19 (the disease) and SARS-CoV2 (the virus that causes it), and was where we put our data analyses.

Excel charts by the both of us. Blame for the rest of this lies with me (Jonathan).

# Ontario COVID-19 information and dataset

Moved the main site, including Ontario COVID-19 data, updated a few times a day, here:
