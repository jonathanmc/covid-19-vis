Its the number of cubic feet per minute of filtered air delivered to a space. If dividing CADR*60 by your room volume is &gt;=5, then it’s appropriately sized. . . Use HEPA filters CADR &gt; 300 and no gimmicks . Many portable HEPA air cleaners can signif’ lower risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in classrooms &lt; 1,000 ft2. Put on stable small table to lower re-suspension from floor. Go CADR &gt; 300 (scfm) for ETS. Avoid devices w/ gimmicky add-ons. Just purchased 12 for my bldg @Portland_State. . . CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate. Companies that sell these usually give the number and not the units. These are standard cubic feet per minute (scfm). CADR = A*B where A is teh single pass removal fraction and B is air flow rate though the device, e.g., scfm. . . https://mobile.twitter.com/CorsIAQ/status/1283260431906205697 . Dr. Richard Corsi . @CorsIAQ . Unknown . 1/ All gr8 points made by . @Poppendieck . . Knows his stuff! I’ve recommended in several forums, including today, to stick to proven technologies. In the case of portable air cleaners, that means those with HEPA filters. As Dustin says, avoid “add ons”. Stick to HEPA. (more) . Dustin Poppendieck . @Poppendieck . Portable air cleaners should be one of the pillars of school room COVID19 risk reduction. Frustrating feedback from teachers: “not allowed due to no recommendation from CDC” and “we can’t give them to one classroom if we don’t give them to all”… 1/3 . 9:59 PM · Jul 23, 2020·Twitter Web App . 2/ Any portable air cleaner (PAC) that is worth considering should have a stated Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). Those that do not, probably don’t for a reason. The CADR is usually certified (in North America) by AHAM - https://aham.org. (more) . 3/ CADR is the product of 2 numbers (eta x Q). Eta is the single-pass removal efficiency for a pollutant (fraction of pollutant removed with one pass through a PAC). Q is the volumetric flow rate of air (e.g., standard cubic feet per minute [scfm]) through a PAC. (more) . 4/ Some PACs not based on HEPA filtration may have a relatively large eta but very low value of Q. Companies that sell these have touted their high removal efficiency (despite a low &amp; unstated CADR). Efficient but not effective! You are not told that part of the story. . 5/ For a HEPA-based air cleaner you can take the CADR &amp; multiply it by 60 to get cubic feet per hour. Then divide by room volume (floor area x ceiling height). The resulting value has units of per hour (i.e., 1/hr), the same units as outdoor air exchange rate. (more) . 6/ So, you can think of a PAC as delivering an equivalent additional outdoor air exchange rate (hence Clean Air Delivery Rate). Example, if the actual air exchange rate is 2/hr and you have a CADR*60/volume = 2/hr it is like you just doubled outdoor air exchange rate. (more) . 7/ If the mean removal pathways for particles in an indoor environment are outdoor air exchange (ventilation) and a PAC, in previous example the particle levels in air would be reduced by 50% relative to just ventilation. If there is recirculation through an HVAC system (more) . 8/ with filtration in the unit, the PAC will still reduce particle levels but not with the same impact (as there are now three major removal mechanisms). For a typical K-12 classroom or large bedroom, etc., look for PAC w/ HEPA that have CADR &gt; 300 scfm for … (more) . 9/ smoke (very small particles). If it has a high CADR for these particles it will do well for 1 micron and greater particles that contain viruses. . I hope that this is helpful. .

Its the number of cubic feet per minute of filtered air delivered to a space. If dividing CADR*60 by your room volume is &gt;=5, then it’s appropriately sized. . . Use HEPA filters CADR &gt; 300 and no gimmicks . Many portable HEPA air cleaners can signif’ lower risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in classrooms &lt; 1,000 ft2. Put on stable small table to lower re-suspension from floor. Go CADR &gt; 300 (scfm) for ETS. Avoid devices w/ gimmicky add-ons. Just purchased 12 for my bldg @Portland_State. . . CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate. Companies that sell these usually give the number and not the units. These are standard cubic feet per minute (scfm). CADR = A*B where A is teh single pass removal fraction and B is air flow rate though the device, e.g., scfm. . . https://mobile.twitter.com/CorsIAQ/status/1283260431906205697 . Dr. Richard Corsi . @CorsIAQ . Unknown . 1/ All gr8 points made by . @Poppendieck . . Knows his stuff! I’ve recommended in several forums, including today, to stick to proven technologies. In the case of portable air cleaners, that means those with HEPA filters. As Dustin says, avoid “add ons”. Stick to HEPA. (more) . Dustin Poppendieck . @Poppendieck . Portable air cleaners should be one of the pillars of school room COVID19 risk reduction. Frustrating feedback from teachers: “not allowed due to no recommendation from CDC” and “we can’t give them to one classroom if we don’t give them to all”… 1/3 . 9:59 PM · Jul 23, 2020·Twitter Web App . 2/ Any portable air cleaner (PAC) that is worth considering should have a stated Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). Those that do not, probably don’t for a reason. The CADR is usually certified (in North America) by AHAM - https://aham.org. (more) . 3/ CADR is the product of 2 numbers (eta x Q). Eta is the single-pass removal efficiency for a pollutant (fraction of pollutant removed with one pass through a PAC). Q is the volumetric flow rate of air (e.g., standard cubic feet per minute [scfm]) through a PAC. (more) . 4/ Some PACs not based on HEPA filtration may have a relatively large eta but very low value of Q. Companies that sell these have touted their high removal efficiency (despite a low &amp; unstated CADR). Efficient but not effective! You are not told that part of the story. . 5/ For a HEPA-based air cleaner you can take the CADR &amp; multiply it by 60 to get cubic feet per hour. Then divide by room volume (floor area x ceiling height). The resulting value has units of per hour (i.e., 1/hr), the same units as outdoor air exchange rate. (more) . 6/ So, you can think of a PAC as delivering an equivalent additional outdoor air exchange rate (hence Clean Air Delivery Rate). Example, if the actual air exchange rate is 2/hr and you have a CADR*60/volume = 2/hr it is like you just doubled outdoor air exchange rate. (more) . 7/ If the mean removal pathways for particles in an indoor environment are outdoor air exchange (ventilation) and a PAC, in previous example the particle levels in air would be reduced by 50% relative to just ventilation. If there is recirculation through an HVAC system (more) . 8/ with filtration in the unit, the PAC will still reduce particle levels but not with the same impact (as there are now three major removal mechanisms). For a typical K-12 classroom or large bedroom, etc., look for PAC w/ HEPA that have CADR &gt; 300 scfm for … (more) . 9/ smoke (very small particles). If it has a high CADR for these particles it will do well for 1 micron and greater particles that contain viruses. . I hope that this is helpful. .

Envelope . The coronavirus virion envelope probably contains two to three proteins, at least one of which is glycosylated. Treatment of corona virus virions with the detergent NP40 results in the release of a ribonucleoprotein complex from the virion (Kennedy and JohnsonLussenburg, 1975/1976; MacNaughton et ai., 1977). Through the use of this method and bromelin digestion, MacNaughton et ai. (1977) suggested that the proteins VP97, GP81, and VP33 are located in the viral envelope of infectious bronchitis virus. In like manner, GP30 and GP28 are probably components of the envelope of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Garwes and Pocock, 1975; Garwes et ai., 1976). When virions of mouse hepatitis virus (A59V) are digested with pronase or bromelin, GP23 is digested to a nonglycosylated protein, P*18, suggesting that GP23 is on the surface of the envelope with a tail of about 18,000 daltons embedded in the envelope (Sturman, 1977; Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . 1979 Review of coronavirae generally (not specifically SARS2) . good summary of cleaning tips: . https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/infectious-disease/How-we-know-disinfectants-should-kill-the-COVID-19-coronavirus/98/web/2020/03 . Of course, for the products to be effective, they should be used according to directions. The recommended contact time for common disinfectants ranges from 30 s to 10 min. Wiping them off too soon might clean the surface without disinfecting it, says Brian Sansoni of the American Cleaning Institute, a trade group for the cleaning products industry. . “Each disinfectant product—be it a spray or wipe, for instance—is formulated differently,” Sansoni says. Different products require different amounts of time to effectively kill a particular germ or virus. . Cleaning electronic devices like smartphones can be particularly challenging, with concerns about damaging sensitive components and coatings. . “Don’t use bleach,” Apple directs in recently released cleaning guidance for its products. The tech company says it’s safe to gently wipe keyboards and displays with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. . Gerba recommends disinfecting wipes for cleaning other surfaces, too. With spray-and-wipe products, consumers often wipe the product up before it can do its job. But in studies done in people’s homes, they are more likely to let a surface air-dry after swabbing it with the wipe, giving the disinfectant compounds time to work. . “Disinfecting wipes win hands-down,” he says. .",

But just as South Korea appeared to be descending into catastrophe, the country stopped the virus in its tracks. The government demanded that the Shincheonji Church turn over its full membership list, through which the Ministry of Health identified thousands of worshippers. All were ordered to self-isolate. Within days, thousands of people in Daegu were tested for the virus. Individuals with the most serious cases were sent to hospitals, while those with milder cases checked into isolation units at converted corporate training facilities. The government used a combination of interviews and cellphone surveillance to track down the recent contacts of new patients and ordered those contacts to self-isolate as well. . … . In response to MERS, South Korea rewrote much of its infectious-disease-prevention legislation. To expedite testing, it gave laboratories the green light to use unapproved diagnostic kits during a public-health emergency. To expand contact tracing, it gave health authorities warrantless access to CCTV footage and the geolocation data from the new patients’ phones. To increase transparency, the new laws required local governments to send prompt alerts, such as emergency texts, to disclose the recent whereabouts of new patients. “The government has failed, and the people have lost their trust,” declared Moon Jae-in, the head of the opposition party during the MERS outbreak. The public approved of both the sentiment and its source. Two years later, Moon was elected president of South Korea. . testing .

The index case (superspreader-1) of the outbreak at the SMC was a 35-year-old man who had been exposed to MERS-CoV at PTSM Hospital during May 15 to 17 [19,20]. He developed a fever on May 21. Despite antibiotic treatment, his pneumonia became aggravated and tachypnea developed, so he eventually visited the emergency room (ER) at SMC on May 27. During his 58-hour stay at the ER, he experienced vigorous coughing and watery diarrhea. On May 29, the Korea CDC found he was staying there. A laboratory test confirmed MERS-CoV infection and he was transferred to the Seoul National University Hospital, a government-designated isolation facility on May 30. . The second wave of the epidemic: the outbreak at SMC . Many individuals had been exposed to the superspreader-1 at the ER, and contact tracing identified 675 patients, an estimated 683 visitors, and 218 HCWs as contacts of superspreader-1. Of them, 278 were quarantined and 617 were under active monitoring. As a result of exposure to superspreader-1, 82 had laboratory-confirmed MERSCoV infection, and an additional 10 were secondarily infected from them [20,21]. . . . . . x 2018-12 - Minki Sung, Seongmin Jo, Sang-Eun Lee, Moran Ki, Bo Youl Choi, and JinKwan Hong - Airflow as a Possible Transmission Route of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome at an Initial Outbreak Hospital in Korea - Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018 Dec; 15(12): 2757.

Study of a cluster of 17 COVID-19 patients who got it from a mall. Traced close contacts. Not sure if tested everyone. . Incubation period 7.3 period (range 1-17) days. . On January 22, the mall was shut down. During January 19–February 9, COVID-19 was diagnosed for 7 mall staff from floors B1–3 and for 10 mall customers. Close contacts associated with the mall were traced, and COVID-19 was confirmed for 11 persons. Sixteen patients had had direct contact with other patients or had gone shopping in the mall. The average incubation period was 7.3 (range 1–17) days. . May be aerosol/air spread. . Transmission started amongst co-workers on a floor of a mall, and spread to customers and other shopkeepers who shared the restroom and elevators. They swabbed the elevators and found nothing, so this may have been airborne spread. . Until now, no evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can survive outside the body for long. However, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus demonstrates high robustness and a strong capability to survive outside the body and can remain infectious for up to 60 minutes after aerosolization (4). Hence, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our study could have resulted from spread via fomites (e.g., elevator buttons or restroom taps) or virus aerosolization in a confined public space (e.g., restrooms or elevators). All case-patients other than those on floor 7 were female, including a restroom cleaner, so common restroom use could have been the infection source. For case-patients who were customers in the shopping mall but did not report using the restroom, the source of infection could have been the elevators. The Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention detected the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 on a doorknob at a patient’s house (5), but Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention test results for an environmental sample from the surface of a mall elevator wall and button were negative. . … . We cannot exclude the possibility of unknown infected persons (e.g., asymptomatic carriers) spreading the virus. However, according to screening protocols implemented by the Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, we traced all close contacts and included all patients with positive PCR results, including the asymptomatic carrier (patient A), in this study. Our findings appear to indicate that low intensity transmission occurred without prolonged close contact in this mall; that is, the virus spread by indirect transmission. . NOTE: Low intensity transmission occurred without prolonged close contact. Contrast with SK call centre where duration of contact seemed to be most important.

Of 1,143 persons who were tested for COVID-19, a total of 97 (8.5%, 95% CI 7.0%–10.3%) had confirmed cases. Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5% (95% CI 36.9%–50.4%). The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2% (95% CI 11.6%– 22.0%). . Of the 97 persons with confirmed COVID-19, only 4 (1.9%) remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine, and none of their household contacts acquired secondary infections. Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings. . . . Good immediate follow up and testing . Building X was closed on March 9, 2020, immediately after the outbreak was reported. We offered testing to all occupants (office workers and apartment residents) during March 9–12. We collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens from PUIs for immediate real-time reverse transcription PCR testing; the average turnaround time was 12–24 hours. Confirmed case-patients were isolated, and negative case-patients were mandated to stay quarantined for 14 days. We followed and retested all test-negative case-patients until the end of quarantine. We also investigated, tested, and monitored household contacts of all confirmed case-patients for 14 days after discovery, regardless of symptoms. During March 13–16, we sent a total of 16,628 text messages to persons who stayed &gt;5 minutes near the building X; we tracked these persons by using cell phone location data. The messages instructed the recipients to avoid contact with others and go to the nearest COVID-19 screening center to get tested. . Duration is the key. . We described the epidemiologic characteristics of a COVID-19 outbreak centered in a call center in South Korea. We identified 97 confirmed COVID-19 case-patients in building X, indicating an attack rate of 8.5%. However, if we restrict our results the 11th floor, the attack rate was as high as 43.5%. This outbreak shows alarmingly that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be exceptionally contagious in crowded office settings such as a call center. The magnitude of the outbreak illustrates how a high-density work environment can become a high-risk site for the spread of COVID-19 and potentially a source of further transmission. Nearly all the case-patients were on one side of the building on 11th floor. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the predecessor of SARS-CoV-2, exhibited multiple superspreading events in 2002 and 2003, in which a few persons infected others, resulting in many secondary cases. Despite considerable interaction between workers on different floors of building X in the elevators and lobby, spread of COVID-19 was limited almost exclusively to the 11th floor, which indicates that the duration of interaction (or contact) was likely the main facilitator for further spreading of SARS-CoV-2. . This outbreak investigation has several limitations. First, we could not track these cases to another cluster, making it difficult to identify the actual index case-patient. Second, not all clinical information was available for all confirmed cases, prohibiting detailed description of clinical syndromes. Date of symptom onset by office seat would be informative in understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission in close contact area. However, our findings demonstrate the power of screening all potentially exposed persons and show that early containment can be implemented and used in the middle of national COVID-19 outbreak. By testing all potentially exposed persons and their contacts to facilitate the isolation of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 case-patients, we might have helped interrupt transmission chains.  . . . . . x 2020-04 Guo et al.

On March 19, 2020, case-patient A0 returned to Heilongjiang Province from the United States; she was asked to quarantine at home. She lived alone during her stay in Heilongjiang Province. She had negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serum antibody tests on March 31 and April 3. . *** Patient B1.1 was the downstairs neighbor of case-patient A0. They used the same elevator in the building but not at the same time and did not have close contact otherwise. . On March 26, B1.1’s mother, B2.2, and her mother’s boyfriend, B2.3, visited and stayed in B1.1’s home all night. On March 29, B2.2 and B2.3 attended a party with patient C1.1 and his sons, C1.2 and C1.3. . On April 2, C1.1 suffered a stroke and was admitted to hospital 1. His sons, C1.2 and C1.3, cared for him in ward area 1 of the hospital. Patient C1.1 shared the same clinical team and items, such as a microwave, with other patients in the ward. On April 6, patient C1.1 was transferred to hospital 2 because of fever; C1.2 and C1.3 accompanied him. . On April 7, patient B2.3 first noted symptoms of COVID-19. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on April 9, the first confirmed case in this cluster. His close contacts, B1.1, B2.1, B2.2, and C1.1, subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on April 9 or 10. Patient C1.1 was quarantined in hospital 2 when he tested positive on April 9. The epidemiologic investigation showed that none of these 5 persons had a history of travel or residence in affected areas with sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the 14 days before diagnosis, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 came from contact with other persons. . * During C1.1’s admission at hospital 1, a total of 28 other persons, D1.1–BB1.1, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in ward area 1. Because all patients in the ward could ambulate, 4 persons, CC1.1, DD1.1, EE1.1, and FF1.1, were infected in other wards and in the computed tomography room of hospital 1. Among hospital 1 staff, 5 nurses and 1 doctor were infected. In hospital 2, another 20 persons, GG1.1–VV1.1, were infected in the ward where C1.1 stayed (Figure). . On April 9, investigators also learned that A0, B1.1’s neighbor, had returned on March 19 from the United States, where COVID-19 cases had been detected. Investigators performed SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody tests on A0 on April 10 and 11. SARS-CoV-2 serum IgM was negative but IgG was positive, indicating that A0 was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (5,6). Therefore, we believe A0 was an asymptomatic carrier (7,8) and that B1.1 was infected by contact with surfaces in the elevator in the building where they both lived (9). Other residents in A0’s building tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and serum antibodies. . On April 15, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention sequenced the entire genomes of 21 samples from the cluster. Viral genomes were identical in 18 cases and 3 other cases had a difference of 1–2 nucleotides, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 came from the same point of origin. The viral genome sequences from the cluster were distinct from the viral genomes previously circulating in China, indicating the virus originated abroad (10) and suggesting case A0 was the origin of infection for this cluster. . All persons in this cluster, including those who lived in the same community and had close contact with SARS-CoV-2–positive patients or visited the 2 hospitals during April 2–15, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and serum antibodies. As of April 22, 2020, A0 remained asymptomatic, and a total of 71 SARS-CoV-2–positive cases had been identified in the cluster. . . . . . Hong Mei House .

Abstract . Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in more than 200 countries. Thousands of health workers have been infected, and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities, and prisons. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for healthcare workers caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whereas the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initially recommended airborne precautions. The 1- to 2-meter (≈3–6 feet) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes that large droplets do not travel further than 2 meters (≈6 feet). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance traveled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the WHO, CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1- to 2-meter (≈3–6 feet) rule of spatial separation. Of 10 studies on horizontal droplet distance, 8 showed droplets travel more than 2 meters (≈6 feet), in some cases up to 8 meters (≈26 feet). Several studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) support aerosol transmission, and 1 study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (≈13 feet) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests that infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, and remain viable 3 hours after aerosolization. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19. . Transmission of pathogens and whether airborne . Some issues arise relating to size and airborne transmission. . First, that SARS2 falls to the ground. It is too big. This is nonsense. Below we’ll see it is 120nM (0.12uM) and smaller than many “airborne” pathogens. Bigger things than viruses easily float in the air. For example, particles 100 times larger (100uM) than coronaviruses (0.1uM) float. . Second, that SARS2 is too small to be filtered by HEPA. HEPA will filter particles smaller than 120nM. . Third, that SARS2 is too small to be filtered by cloth masks. These pathogens are breathed out in saliva droplets, which are much larger than the pathogens. Furthermore, these saliva droplets contain salts and proteins, and much more of these than the pathogens. To this end, the size of the virus is somewhat irrelevant compared to the size of the droplets exhaled, even after evaporation of the saliva. Droplets will be the same size regardless of virus contained within them, because the droplets are much bigger than viruses. More importantly also blocking the airflow, both in and out. . In terms of airborne transmission, certain pathogens are accepted to travel in an airborne manner. Measles, TB, chickenpox. . However, many others have been found or suspected to be airborne as well, including bacteria, which are bigger than viruses. . Coronaviruses (CoVs) . Coronavirus is about 120nM (0.12uM) . QUOTE: . The average diameter of the virus particles is around 120 nm (.12 μm). The diameter of the envelope is ~80 nm (.08 μm) and the spikes are ~20 nm (.02 μm) long. . citation: wikipedia . . . . . Measles (accepted to be airborne) . Measles is accepted to be contagious through the air. This appears to be because of its high R_e number of 12 to 18, although this number is probably out of date, and an overestimate, and the R_e for SARS2 (of 2 or 3) is probably too low and it is actually likely around 5 to 9. . R_e is just a measure of infectivity. So a high one may suggest airborne to account for the fast spread, a low one really doesn’t tell you whether it is airborne or not. . The measles virus has different sizes, but is generally between 50 and 500 nM (.05 to .5uM). . . In conclusion, MeV particles are polymorphic and have a diameter ranging between 50 and 1000 nm, and particles of all sizes are infective. These results suggest that MeV, particularly large particles, can be a possible carrier of foreign viral antigens or the genome for a chimeric vaccine . citation: 2005 - Kouichi Sano et al - MeV particles vary in size and all are infective, Bulletin of the Osaka Medical College 53(2):107-114, 2007 107. https://www.osaka-med.ac.jp/deps/b-omc/articles/532/532daikoku.pdf .

R0 . x Perspectives - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5294980/ . - says R0=9-18 . The range of the basic reproduction number R0 (a metric for transmissibility) for measles was estimated to be 9–18, exceeding that of other viral diseases (e.g., smallpox R0 = 5–7 and polio R0 = 4–13) [41,42]. Based on the high R0, the level of population immunity (herd immunity) necessary to interrupt measles transmission is approximately 95% [42]. Measles is often the first vaccine preventable disease detected following a breakdown in routine immunization activities, and as such is a “canary in the coal mine”, and a leading indicator of the status of vaccination programs [43]. . 41.

Tuberculosis, a bacteria and therefore much larger than SARS2, is accepted to transmit in an airborne manner and be very infective. Takes very few bacteria to lodge in lungs and cause infection. One study suggests one bacterium can do it. . Note the distinctive cough: A cough lasting 3 weeks or longer is a symptom of TB disease. TB bacteria most commonly grow in the lungs, and can cause symptoms such as: A bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer. Pain in the chest. . How big is it? 2-4 micrometers wide (2000-4000uM) and 0.5mM (500uM). Therefore much larger than CoVs. . QUOTE: . Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a fairly large nonmotile rod-shaped bacterium distantly related to the Actinomycetes. Many non pathogenic mycobacteria are components of the normal flora of humans, found most often in dry and oily locales. The rods are 2-4 micrometers in length and 0.2-0.5 um in width. . . . . . Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. . TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. . About one-quarter of the world’s population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the disease and cannot transmit the disease. . People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. . When a person develops active TB disease, the symptoms (such as cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People with active TB can infect 5–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. Without proper treatment, 45% of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die. . citation: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis .
